Author: Aly Matrawy

Description: 

Developed a C++ and Qt-based simulation software for the Neureset EEG neurofeedback device, featuring EEG signal processing, user-friendly UI, and comprehensive session management. Designed system architecture, conducted rigorous testing


Neureset is a consumer EEG direct neurofeedback device based on the LENS Neurofeedback system. It consists of an EEG headset with 21 electrodes connected to a handheld device serving as both signal processor and user interface. The device automatically reads EEG signals, establishes baseline frequencies, and delivers therapeutic electromagnetic treatments to each of the 21 electrode sites in sessions managed through a simple menu interface, providing session progress and log functionalities.
